This folder is where we are going to put anything related to design
(e.g. application design flowcharts, use cases, brainstorming, etc.)

In the ideas document you are welcome to make random notes about ideas
regarding design structure, impelementation, API's we could utilize,
functionality, or anything you can think of that can help further our
project.

If you want to make new files, new folders, or anything else, just go
ahead and do it!
