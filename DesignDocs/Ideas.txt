In this document you are welcome to make random notes about ideas
regarding design structure, impelementation, API's we could utilize,
functionality, or anything you can think of that can help further our
project.

Baby Step Goals:
let's make an application design flowchart
let's figure out how to use the google maps API
let's figure out how to modularize our app (break it into parts)

Focus on the essence: what are some problems we need to solve?
2. How do we find doctors and add them automatically?
3. Don't we need to make a remote server somewhere that people need to interface to?
  a. we have to have a database that users can search through...
  b. we need to have a client side gui that users interact with...
4. this is a two part project. 1. server application and 2. gui application
